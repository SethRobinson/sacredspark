# Sacred Spark - a simple Unity puzzle game for Ludum Dare 55

This is a little puzzle game I created for Ludum Dare 55.  The theme was "Summoning".

I started with my Unity template project, copied a few snippets from other projects, and used a ton of AI.  Entering LD as "Jam".

It gets faster as you go, but this also causes the scores to increase and make combos (both longer explosions and chain reactions) even more powerful.

I think 1,400 points is a decent score.

Hacked in mobile controls at the last minute, you'll only see them if you have a touch screen device, I hope.
