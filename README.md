# Sacred Spark - a simple Unity puzzle game for Ludum Dare 55

This is a little puzzle game I created for Ludum Dare 55.  The theme was "Summoning".

I started with my Unity template project, copied a few snippets from other projects, and used a ton of AI.  Entering LD as "Jam".

It gets faster as you go, but this also causes the scores to increase and make combos (both longer explosions and chain reactions) even more powerful.

I think 1,400 points is a decent score.

Supports gamepad (including the web version), keyboard, and touch screen (touch screen will only show when run on mobile devices)

AI created title screen song lyrics:

In every shadowed corner, sparks begin to dance<br>
Align the sacred jewels, unlock the fire's trance<br>
With each gem in place, behold the tablet's glow<br>
Light the sacred flame, let the magic show<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Let it spark, let it spark, let it spark, let it spark<br>
Ignite the puzzle's answer, sacred Spark<br>
Surrounded by puzzles, the journey's just begun<br>
Place the jewels of mystery, one by one<br>
Colors woven with light, a vision to embark<br>
Piece the riddle just right, call forth the Sacred Spark<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Watch it shine, watch it shine, watch it shine, watch it shine<br>
Awaken ancient power, time to redefine<br>
In whispered tones, the chant begins, let elements align<br>
Trace the runes, connect the dots, a path of fate's design<br>
With careful hands, the puzzle's solved, the jewel's warmth to seek<br>
Release the flame, a sacred blaze, where light and magic speak<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Let it rise, let it rise, let it rise, let it rise<br>
Summon with your wisdom, see through the disguise<br>

AI created game over song lyrics:

Shine, oh shine, in this game we play<br>
Sacred flame, ignite the spark today<br>
Matching gems and tablets we unite<br>
In this puzzle, our power comes alight<br>
[Post-Chorus]<br>
Through the game<br>
LIKE A FLAME through the board we claim<br>
Burn, oh burn, with fiery might<br>
With every move, we claim the night<br>
Align the jewels, set the board aflame<br>
In Sacred Spark, rise to fame<br>
[Pre-Chorus]<br>
Feel the heat<br>
WITH EACH BEAT, our hearts in fiery game<br>
Fan the blaze, keep the rhythm tight<br>
Stones aglow, our conquest burning bright<br>
Summon fire, carve your name in sparks<br>
Sacred heroes leave their blazing marks<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Sacred Spark, where we light the dark<br>
Fervent flames, from a tiny spark<br>
